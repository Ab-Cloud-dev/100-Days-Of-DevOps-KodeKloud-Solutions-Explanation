# 100-Days-Of-DevOps-KodeKloud-Solutions-Explanation


A personal / community challenge to learn DevOps tools, concepts and best practices over 100 days. Built around the ‚Äú[100 Days of DevOps](https://kodekloud.com/100-days-of-devops) track from KodeKloud. Each day I complete a task, document what I learned, and show how it applies in real-world environments.

## üéØ What is this

- **Purpose**: To build up hands-on experience in DevOps through small, daily tasks.
- **Source**: Based on the [100 Days of DevOps](https://kodekloud.com/100-days-of-devops) track from KodeKloud.
- **Goal**: By the end of Day 100, I want to have a portfolio of real DevOps workflows, tools, scripts, etc., plus explanations of how they are used in professional settings.

---

- Each **Day-XX** folder contains:
  1. the problem/task statement or link,
  2. my solution (scripts, config, code, manifests etc.), and
  3. notes / reflections, including how the task connects to real-world usag

## üìù How I Document Each Task

For each day I try to cover:

1. **Task description** ‚Äî what was asked
2. **Solution** ‚Äî code / scripts / configs
3. **Explanation / Walkthrough** ‚Äî step by step what I did and why.

## ‚úÖ How to Use This Repo

- View each day‚Äôs folder to see both the task and my working solution.
- Use the `README.md` to understand the concepts, not just the commands.
- <u><mark>**While using the solution from this Repo, in completing the task make sure to change name of the folder/service/ as per your solution as the the underlying task remains the same.**</mark></u>.
