Fyi: A fork is a complete copy of someone else’s repository (including its commits, branches, tags, etc.) into your own account.

It’s different from git clone because:

clone → makes a local copy on your machine.

fork → makes a copy on the server (GitHub/GitLab/etc.), under your own account.

⚙️ How it works

You find a project (e.g., github.com/someuser/project).

You click Fork on GitHub.

Now you have your own copy at github.com/yourname/project.

You can clone your fork locally

# Why use Forking?

To contribute to open-source projects without direct write access.

To experiment freely without affecting the original repo.

To maintain your own modified version of someone else’s project.
